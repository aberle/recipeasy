recipeasy
=========

A web app that helps users find recipes that have been submitted to the food blog aggregation site, FoodGawker.


To-Do
=========
* Add 'about' page to include app info and give credit to FoodGawker
* Add colored bars to page sides to make it feel more 'narrow' on desktop
* Add simple filtering to randomized recipes (e.g. chicken recipes, chicken+pasta+legumes recipes, etc.)
* Make recipe title clickable
* Make clickable links open in new tabs, not replace current tab
* Make bootstrap files point to CDN rather than local files (for easier deployment)
